  Hello!

  I'm a web developer with 8 years of experience, specializing in backend services.
  The technologies I have the most experience with are Java, Spring, Postgres, ElasticSearch, and Kafka.

  I'm interested in all things performance-related.

          Vendor platforms & Marketing
        description: |
          Working as a principal engineer for Jumia's vendor platforms, together with the help of 3 development teams.<br>
          It involves mainly catalog and order management and the main tech stack is **Spring Boot**, **Postgres**, **ElasticSearch** and **Kafka**.

          The focus of the project is to modernize Jumia's vendor platform from a legacy **PHP** application into more scalable **Java** microservices.
          With the main challenge being it's overall scale:
            - large system with almost 15 years of historical data,
            - tens of thousands of integrated vendors,
            - hundreds of millions of products,
            - across more than 10 ventures.

          More recently, I've expanded my scope to Jumia's marketing services, handling marketing communications and monetization services.
          Using **Go** with **Gin** and **GORM**, and **Kubernetes** for all deployments.

          Miscellaneous projects
        description: |
          Focusing on a individual contributor technical role, I integrated a team which was responsible for some miscellaneous, central projects in Jumia, all using **Spring Boot**.

          Here I was the technical leader for services handling:
            - Authentication and authorization for all internal tools
            - Transactional communications

          I also was involved from the ground up on projects responsible for:
            - General document printing for transactional systems (e.g. shipping labels, invoices, etc)
            - Integration with local tax authorities in Uganda and Egypt

          The project I would highlight, and where I had my main contribution, was the Search Project.
          This is a availability and performance critical service that handles all the search and navigation traffic across the Jumia websites.

          Here I had the opportunity of working on top of **ElasticSearch** and **Kafka**, with a big focus on metrics, AB testing and data driven development.

          Fulfillment - Order and Warehouse management
        description: |
          Led a team of around 7 people, responsible warehouse and order management systems in a multitude of technology stacks.

          In this project I inherited a monolith service in **PHP** that was being rewritten into two separate sets of microservices. One using the **Play Framework**, another using **Spring boot**.

          I also had the opportunity to interact with other databases like **MariaDB** and **MongoDB**, and started using **Docker** for deployments and CI builds.

          Logistics - Package management
        description: |
          Worked as a fullstack developer for a logistics system that managed all package deliveries in Jumia.

          The main goal of this project was to revamp the way Jumia handled package and delivery management, in **Java**.

          This project was when I first had real contact with **Spring**, learned about message brokers with **RabbitMQ**, and SQL databases in production with **PostgreSQL**.

          Portuguese company developing software for taxi dispatching.

          Worked as an intern during the year I was writing my master thesis.
          During this year, I worked on an invoicing system to be used for issuing invoices for taxi rides and integrating them with portuguese tax authorities.

          This was my first interaction with web development (in **Python**), and started to get some experience with web frameworks and ORMs (using **Flask** **SQLAlchemy**).

      Outside work, I love to travel. Currently on a mission to visit 40 different countries before I turn 40.<br>
      I'm also interested in photography, climbing, orienteering and I've also been recently introduced to the world of wine.

      While I'm still sat at my desk, I like to explore some different programming languages for small toy projects (although recently I fell in love with Rust and it's been hard to let it go).
