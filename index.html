Hello!

I'm a web developer with 9+ years of experience, specializing in backend services.

Short but sweet experience where I learnt a lot about Contact Centers.

Focusing on call-recording related services, where the main challenges are:

- Ensuring a reliable and resilient recording environment, integrating with 3rd party services.
- Modernization of a legacy application to an event-based architecture, running on a cloud environment.

The tech stack includes mainly:

- **Java** with **SpringBoot**
- Both on-premise and cloud deployments (using **GCP** and **Kubernetes**)

Modernizing Jumia's vendor platform from a legacy **PHP** application into more scalable **Java** microservices, with the help of 3 development teams.
It involves predominantly catalog and order management and the main tech stack is **Spring Boot**, **Postgres**, **ElasticSearch**, and **Kafka**.

The primary challenge is its overall scale:

- a large system with almost 15 years of historical data,
- tens of thousands of integrated vendors,
- hundreds of millions of products,
- across more than 10 ventures.

For the last few months I expanded my scope to Jumia's marketing services, responsible mainly for handling marketing communications.
This set of services was using **Go** with **Gin** and **GORM**, and **Kubernetes** for all deployments.

Integrated a team responsible for various major projects in Jumia, all using **Spring Boot**. I was the technical leader for services handling:

- Authentication and authorization for all internal tools,
- Transactional communications.

I was also involved from the ground up in projects responsible for:

- General document printing for transactional systems (e.g. shipping labels, invoices, etc),
- Integration with local tax authorities in Uganda and Egypt.

I highlight the Search Project, to which I made my main contribution.
This is an availability and performance-critical service that handles all the search and navigation traffic across the Jumia websites.

Here I had the opportunity to work on top of **ElasticSearch** and **Kafka**, with a big focus on metrics, AB testing, and data-driven development.

Led a team of around seven people, responsible for warehouse and order management systems in a multitude of technology stacks.

I inherited a monolith service in **PHP** that was being rewritten into two separate sets of microservices: one using the **Play Framework**, and another using **Spring Boot**.

I also had the opportunity to interact with other databases like **MariaDB** and **MongoDB** and started using **Docker** for deployments and CI builds.

Worked as a full-stack developer for a logistics system that managed all package deliveries in Jumia.

Outside work, I love to travel.
I'm currently on a mission to visit 40 different countries before I turn 40.
I'm also enthusiastic about photography, climbing, and orienteering.

I've also been recently introduced to the fascinating worlds of coffee and wine.

While I'm still sitting at my desk, I like to explore some different programming languages for small toy projects.
Recently, I fell in love with Rust and it's been hard to let it go.
